# next.js-react-material-skeleton
Skeleton Project for Next.js + React + Material UI

This skeleton will make it easy to create an application based on:

- Next.js by ZEIT https://nextjs.org/ - For Server-Side-Rendering
- Material-UI - For a modern User interface / UX - https://material-ui.com/

It has some boilerplate included which will make the following things easy to understand:

- Navigation from Page A to Page B
- Customisation of the Material-UI Theme
- Adding global-level CSS
- Modularize JS / JSX Components to reduce code duplication
- Prepared for "SEO"
- Static files
